# Chatting Application

## Overview
This project is a simple chat application that allows multiple clients to connect to a central server and communicate with each other. Using `ServerSocket`, the application broadcasts messages received from one client to all connected clients, enabling real-time group communication.

## Features
1. **Multi-Client Connectivity:** Multiple clients can connect to the central server.
2. **Message Broadcasting:** Messages sent by one client are broadcast to all connected clients.
3. **Real-Time Communication:** Facilitates real-time text-based communication among users.

## Technologies Used
- **Java:** Core language used for implementing server and client functionality.
- **ServerSocket:** Used for handling multiple client connections and communication.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine
- A code editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/code-nd-coffee/Chatting-Application.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd chatting-application

Running the Server
1. Compile the Server.java file
   ```bash
   javac Server.java

2. Run the server
   ```bash
    java Server

Running the Client
1. Compile the Client.java file
   ```bash
   javac Client.java
2. Run the client
   ```bash
   java Client

Usage
• Server: Start the server by running the Server class. The server will listen for client connections.
• Client: Start multiple instances of the Client class to simulate different clients. Each client can send messages, which will be broadcast to all connected clients.

Future Enhancements
• Implement private messaging between clients.
• Add user authentication.
• Improve the user interface for better usability.
